  “Your clothes are a way to present yourself to the world" said the most famous maven
in designer industry Miuccia Prada. This means that clothes makes the man. People make their
own fashion statement with their style of clothing. If you wear a baggy or scruffy sweater,
people will consider you as simple and sloppy. If you wear formal and fashionable suits, you will
look like a businesslike and self-confident person. How does this work? Let's talk about trends
and the people who follow them.
It takes many factors for something to become a trend. First, you need a person who
will set the fashion - he is a trendsetter. Then there is a salesman - a person with a good
reputation, whom everyone wants to be. After that comes the turn of the connector, which
shows the society a new trend. Thus, a lot of people buy into this scheme and begin to follow a
new advertised trend.
One of the main trends in the labor market is the profession of a programmer. The
tipping point, due to IT-specialists are now on the increase, has become the development of
computer technology. Now programmers make big money and everyone wants to get this
profession. However, it seems to me that in a couple of decades programmers will become old
hats. When people create robots that do everything themselves, the profession of a
programmer will become a blast from the past.
Now people follow the fashion that famous designers and celebrities dictate to them.
Famous personalities set trends and endorse them by their example. For instance Natalie
Portman, who wears clothes from the fashion house Dior, inspires her fans to copy her and buy
clothes from the same brand.
I am not a fashion victim. I like to dress the way I feel comfortable, so I buyn't things
from high street fashion brands and it suits me. But many of my friends are fashion conscious,
so they are catch on popular trends and pick up on everything that is all the rage.
Now in the music field the popularity of hip-hop and rap is growing. This kind of music
became widespread among young people due to aggressive melodies and daring lyrics. On the
contrary, I like quieter music, but sometimes I also listen to this genre.
As soon as people replaced records with sheet music, the many ways to listen to your
favorite songs appeared. Everyone listens to music differently. Someone prefers streaming to
music on YouTube or RuTube, someone goes to concerts and someone is engaged in piracy.
These people download music to their player or phone without paying and illegally. Because of
this, the music industry is falling into decline with losing money. Most music platforms have
anti-piracy policy platforms and are trying to take over the situation, but that doesn't help.
People continue to listen to music for free, that is, follow trends without paying for it.
Nowadays, it is becoming more difficult to stand out from the crowd. Most who can
afford designer fashion achieve this with exclusive clothing or gadgets. But over time, it will
stop to be fun and this method will slow down a popularity. It seems to me that soon people
will begin to defiantly refuse to follow trends in order to seem special. Such a paradox is the
trend of avoiding trends.
In conclusion, I would like to emphasize once again that trends exist in all areas of our
life. Mostly they are not created by accident. I think the society goes overboard with the role of
trends in our lifestyle. You don’t have to follow them. Don’t be afraid to go out of fashion, just
be yourself and people will understand you.
