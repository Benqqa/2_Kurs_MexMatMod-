  Writer Viktor Pelevin said "Nowadays people learn
about what they think on TV". This phrase means that
media has a big impact on people. Our world provides
entertainment for creating a breathtaking arts and news.
But sometimes it's hard to single out what inspires
people to make such things. Let's talk about what media
is.Media is a broad concept that includes means of
communication and ways of transmitting information.
With the development of the Internet, online
publications and online cinemas are setting popular. On
the contrary, interest in television and print newspapers
has declined.
 Despite this trend, I remain to be passionate about
books. The last book I read was a real page-turner and
was called "The Master and Margarita". This book from
the first pages gets me hooked by its brooding
atmosphere and gripping plot. It tells about Moscow of
the century before last and mysticism. The main
characters were a man called a master who wrote a novel
about God and his beloved Margarita. This book by
Russian author Bulgakov received favorable reviews from
critics around the world. Many writers have tried to take
a leaf out of Bulgakov’s book, but no one has repeated
his success. His firstly used a groundbreaking technique
of combining mythology and realism in his novel.But creators are not always happy about their
success. Many people with household names become
recluses by avoiding media attention. They cut short their
careers by refusing to get royalties and give interviews.
They don't like being popular. They are not afraid of the
expression "Out of sight, out of mind", and continuing to
quietly create art or living for their own pleasure.
 Stanley Kubrick is one of examples of such people. He
admired as one of cinema's greatest talents. As a director
he made only thirteen films, but many of them regarded
as masterpieces and won the nine Oscars. Kubrick was
frequently unwilling to discuss personal matters publicly
and was not afraid to abandon his careers by that fact. It
gave him reputation as an eccentric, reclusive genius. He
had little contact with media, so few people knew what
he looked like.Let's talk about those who find out and provide us
with information about new events. People want to make
a career of foreign correspondents to learn about the
culture of other countries, travel and stay physically fit.
 Also there are some qualities foreign
correspondents must have. They had to be able to make
a discuss without waiting for people to tell you what to
do. They needed to be digitally literate, to be aware of all
digital technologies and lift the current information. For
example, we might mention Rageh Omar’s. He wangled
his way into a mouth's traineeship at the famous
newspaper, but started his career as a stringer. Then he
worked for local newspapers, took a qualification in
journalism in Kosovo and underwent a traineeship
working on radio station. He found out about news from
current affairs program and broadcast them on the air. It
brought home to his correspondent's way to work for
large international corporations.Speaking of creativity and media, we can’t mention
films. I recently viewed the stunning and hilarious
comedy called ‘Always Say Yes’. It's definitely one of the
top classic comedy movies of all the time. It went viral
right away and took the audience by storm after its
premiere. It evokes explosive laughter by adequate and
fresh jokes, which will always remain as 'in the moment'
regardless of time. I laughed at the ridiculous behavior of
the main character and his innocent humor. In spite of
implementation low-quality special effects I advise everyone
to watch this movie.At the end of my monologue, I would like to once
again emphasize the importance of media and arts in our
lives. Regardless of whether the creator is open to the
public or not, he can make real masterpieces of art. The
media, which include journalists and correspondents, tell
us about these masterpieces. Media keep us to date with
the latest news, without which we would be bored to
live.
