  A famous Russian engineer once said that thoughts are not money, because they have never
been superfluous. Engineers are people who constantly focus on solving important problems of
humanity. They spend a lot of time doing mental work and every day make a breakthrough to complete
the project successfully. So, let us talk about these people in more detail.
We do not think about who designed and created all bells and wristles that we use daily. For
example, a mobile phone. But scientists have worked for a century to provide wireless communication
between people. They had been built prototypes of perfect working phones for a long time, and then
had modified every new model.
 Engineers improve people’s lives, refining production technologies, creating new mechanisms and
machines. They design buildings. Survival Engineering is committed to predict the drought and prevent a
destructive tsunami, that might cause mass extinction.
In 2019, the coronavirus epidemic began in the world. It is believed that this is not engineered
GM superbug, but an evolved old virus. Since it is a virus, it is resistant to antibiotics. It constitutes the
threat for the elderly and people with chronic diseases. Many of the people who had been ill with it
died, the rest remained weakened by that disease for a long time. if the epidemic is not contained in
time, then the virus will make modifications to itself and become even more dangerous.
 Engineers around the world are rushing to make a cure for this virus. In some countries,
scientists have already synthesized the vaccine and are doing safety tests to release it into circulation.
One of the largest man-made structure I’ve ever heard about is the Beijing International Airport.
The project will meet a deadline in 2025. The airport will have been down to a science using the latest
technology. It is expected to receive about 70 million people daily and adopt it’s navigation to many
languages.
 I was most impressed by the transport system that will be built into the airport, so people can
change an aircraft to a train and go further to another city. This project will develop Chinese civil and the
world’s civil in general.
Most young people think of engineers as cranks or crazy. Science fiction and movies impact on
teenagers, and therefore they believe that engineers necessarily do strange and extraordinary things -
send probes into space to repel an alien science, deflect comets by colliding with it, or make a robot
which can go through a disastrous hurricane. The absurdity of these prejudices is not rocket science.
Nowadays, an engineer is a very serious profession. I believe that we need to involve more people in this
area and destroy stereotypes about it.
 In conclusion, I would like to note that despite the unpopularity of this profession, it remains very
in demand and highly paid. Engineers are involved in all areas of human life, that is why there will
always be a place for new specialists in this area. They find solutions to the most relevant problems. I'm
glad to study to be an engineer.
